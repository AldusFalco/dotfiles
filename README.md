# dotfiles

I would like to use a method I learned from a colleague [samfelt](https://github.com/samfelt/dotfiles) to setup a configuration file repo. This is for setting up a vm easier. (haven't done this yet)

## config file locations
- Save in:
  - `~/.vimrc`
  - `/etc/tmux.conf` or `~/.tmux.conf`

## doing a Raw setup
- Change vim and tmux confs
- Change transparency to 0 and font size (14 pt)


## TMUX notes

- TPM (tmux plugin manager): https://github.com/tmux-plugins/tpm
    - use `prefix + I` to install after cloning repo and putting it in tmux config
